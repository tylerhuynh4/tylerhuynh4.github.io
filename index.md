* Lab 3

Lab 3, both parts was one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first instances where I had to utilize conversions which was like a puzzle to me. This challenge was great to solve because within this lab, I actually started to utilize my outside resources alongside my partner in order to aid us in completing the lab. Though we did utilize the lab TAs, we also troubleshooted using our online resources, and finally asking our professors. I liked this lab more because of our experience in learning how to find help and troubleshooting using our resources.

* Lab 4

Lab 4, both parts also had the same concept as lab 3 with the unit conversion but also included part 2 which involved creating our own programmed guessing game. This time, it was incredibly fun making my first real game with a programming language, not like those drag and drop kid-friendly code.com stuff. This lab also forced me for the first time to think more creatively with how I structured my code which helped me down the line with other labs.

* Lab 8

Lab 8, part 1 involved creating a pattern using loops which in turn allowed us to create a small image through code. I liked the creativity and uniqueness of the first part and allowing us to code our own pictures/drawings. The second part was terrible though I hated doing all that troubleshooting with the loops. It was easier making pictures with the loops than actual mathematical functions.
